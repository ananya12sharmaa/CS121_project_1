## About Me
- Namaste! This is **Ananya Sharma**.
- I am an *International Freshman* majoring in <ins>Computer Science</ins>.

## What I'm Hoping to Learn
- This semester, I'm *super excited* to learn some in-depth details of <ins>Computer Science</ins> and the **crazy hacker style** command line, which looks so cool!
- I am not a gaming enthusiast, but I wanted to explore this side of Computer Science. So, I am looking forward to incorporating this unix/IDE independent environment in game dev we hopefully would be doing soon!

## Something Interesting About Me
- I enjoy **travelling** and notoriously capturing every moment of life.
- I'm a vegetarian and love experimenting with *Indian recipes*.
- It has been ~~6 months~~ almost 5 months that I am learning to live independently, so far away from my family.

## Favorite Command
Here are some of my  favorite commands I've learned so far:
* Set of these 3 commands, which have a good analogy to shopping process
```
git add .
git commit -m"Added xyz.py"
git push origin main
```

* Another interesting pair of command is the following, which looks so movie-like hacker who is using these techy skills against some evil big corp.
```
  pwd
  ls
```
These look so simple but tell you where you are and the files in it!!
